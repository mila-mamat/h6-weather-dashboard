# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
Build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.


## Functions of the weather dashboard


If I **search for a city**, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history (if it is not included yet)

If the **city name is invalid**, the browser will alert, and the city will not be added to search history list

If I **click on a city in the search history**, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city, and the city is moved to the top of the search history list

When viewing **current weather conditions** for that city, I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

When viewing the **UV index**, I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

When viewing **future weather conditions**, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

If I **refresh the weather dashboard**, I am presented with the last searched city forecast if there is one or it will display "No previous search available"
